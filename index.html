			My name is Muhammad Syafiq Akmal and I am an amateur coder. I am an amateur coder struggling to make my way to the top. I am currently taking a course in NEXT Academy where I study MORE coding. I was born on 29th April in <em>Subang Jaya</em>. Ever since I was young, I have always had an interest in technology. It started with my brother's personal computer where I used to play computer games and a Playstation 2. I frequently wondered how they work and was very curious about it. Although technology was moving very quickly I never had the urge to search about it on the internet. Other than that, I also love to travel the world. Before I took a computing course I had second thoughts all the time because I actually wanted to become a pilot but I was afraid that there wouldn't be any job as there are so many pilots out there but so little job. Anyway, here are some of the places I travelled to.
